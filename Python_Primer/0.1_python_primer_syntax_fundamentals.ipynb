We will talk about each of them in a bit but first lets demonstrate their power. If you have a menial task or a calculation that is repetitive that is when you use the loop. Lets take an example. Say you needed the sum the squares of the first 100 multiples of 13 or represented mathematically $\\sum^{100}_{i=1} (3i)^{2}$ (This would likely not come up for you but this is just an introduction). This would be annoying to do by hand, but it is easily solved in just a four lines of python (I'm not counting comment lines)."
