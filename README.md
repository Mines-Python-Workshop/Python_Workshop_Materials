# Python Workshop

Welcome to the Mines Chemistry Department Programming Workshop!  

This workshop is designed for those new to python, and consists of 3 modules. The first module ([Python Primer](https://github.com/Mines-Python-Workshop/Python_Workshop_Materials/tree/main/Python_Primer)) covers python installation, basic syntax and package installation. If you already have python installed or are comfortable learning basic programming syntax on your own, you may choose to skip this module. The next two modules make up the main workshop and will cover opening files, manipulating data and basic and advanced plotting and the use of generative AI. Day 2 will include time to apply the skills to your own data.

**Details:**  
The Python Primer consists of 3 sub-modules:  
* [`0.0 Software Installation`](https://github.com/Mines-Python-Workshop/Python_Workshop_Materials/blob/main/Python_Primer/0.0_python_primer_software_installation.md) – installing python, dependencies and text editor  
* [`0.1 Syntax Fundamentals`](https://github.com/Mines-Python-Workshop/Python_Workshop_Materials/blob/main/Python_Primer/0.1_python_primer_syntax_fundamentals.ipynb) – basic loops, types, functions and python philosophy  
* [`0.2 Package Installation and Management`](https://github.com/Mines-Python-Workshop/Python_Workshop_Materials/blob/main/Python_Primer/0.2_python_primer_package_installation_and_management.md) – how to handle problematic installations and read documentation
  
Day 1 consists of 4 sub-modules:
* [`1.1 Loading Data from External Files`](./Workshop_Day1/1.1_day1_external_data_files.md) – text files, etc
* [`1.3 Data Visualization with Matplotlib`](./Workshop_Day1/1.3_day1_plotting_with_matplotlib.md) – basic plot types

Day 2 consists of 4 sub-modules:  
* [`2.0 Data Processing and Analysis`]() – statistical analysis, regression and smoothing  
* [`2.1 Complex Formatting and Data Visualization`](2.1_day2_complex_formatting.md) – using class structures to access complex formatting 
* [`2.2 Prompt Engineering for Generative AI`](./2.2_day2_prompt_engineering_for_generative_ai.md) – how to write effective prompts for GPT and interpret the code it writes
* [`2.3 Applications to Your Data`](./2.3_day2_applications_to_your_data.md) – try to apply workshop tools to you own datasets!
